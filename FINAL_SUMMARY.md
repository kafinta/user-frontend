## Key Decisions Made

1. **Sidebar Width**: Recommend fixed width (256px) instead of responsive
   - Better readability
   - Consistent across all screen sizes
   - Easier to maintain

2. **Prop Naming**: Standardize to camelCase
   - `pageTitle` (not `page_title`)
   - Consistency across codebase

3. **Hardcoded Data**: Remove all hardcoded values
   - Earnings: Will come from API
   - Online status: Will come from API
   - User data: Will come from API

4. **API Integration**: Create composables first
   - Reusable state management
   - Consistent pattern with existing code
   - Easy to test

## Files to Create

1. `composables/useBuyerDashboard.ts` (Phase 4)
2. `composables/useSellerDashboard.ts` (Phase 4)

## Files to Modify

**Phase 1 (< 1 hour)**:
- `pages/[username]/buying/dashboard.vue` - Fix prop naming
- `components/Navigation/SideBar/Menu.vue` - Add disabled styling
- `components/Navigation/SideBar/Index.vue` - Remove hardcoded data

**Phase 2 (1-2 hours)**:
- `components/Navigation/SideBar/Index.vue` - Sidebar width, colors
- `components/Layouts/Dashboard.vue` - Menu close on nav

**Phase 3 (2-4 hours)**:
- `components/Navigation/SideBar/Index.vue` - Loading states
- `components/Layouts/Dashboard.vue` - Menu animation

**Phase 4 (2-3 days)**:
- `pages/[username]/buying/dashboard.vue` - API integration
- `pages/[username]/selling/dashboard.vue` - API integration
